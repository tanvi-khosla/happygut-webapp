Ketones are a hot topic these days and have been shown to improve recall in patients with Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment, although more research is needed. In fact, a 2016 review found that Alzheimer’s patients may be better able to use ketones than glucose for brain fuel, leading scientists to posit the therapeutic benefits of ketosis for delaying or correcting brain fuel supply, especially in those with declining functions. Use MCT oil in place of oil in any uncooked or low-temperature recipe. Try adding to mashed avocado and use as a sandwich spread, use in vinaigrettes, stir into almond butter or toss with steamed vegetables. In our recipe, we use it to make a chile oil that’s drizzled over a veggie-packed stir-fry.\r\n\r\nPrepare MCT-chile oil: In a small bowl, whisk MCT oil, chile paste, cilantro and 1 tbsp ginger. Set aside.\r\nIn a large skillet on medium-high, heat olive oil. Add Brussels sprouts, onion, garlic and remaining 1 tbsp ginger and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.\r\nAdd mushrooms, bell pepper, broccolini, tamari, vinegar and honey and cook for 5 minutes, until vegetables are tender. Sprinkle with seeds and stir to mix.\r\nRemove from heat and drizzle with MCT-chile oil; toss to mix well. Serve with brown rice or noodles (if using)."}}, {"model": "happygut.article_list", "pk": 12, "fields": {"image": "https://blogimage.vantagefit.io/vfitimages/2020/09/yoga-in-the-workplace.png", "heading": "How to create your ‘Power Hour’ morning plan?", "adata": "  How we spend the first part our mornings can set the tone for our whole day.

Balancing our circadian rhythms requires that we wake up early, expose our eyes (and an appropriate amount of skin) to morning sunlight, and sleep when it’s dark. \r\n\r\nIf you want to change just one thing about your mornings, try getting outside ASAP. When we see natural sunlight, this stimulates the suprachiasmatic nucleus (or SCN) to send messages throughout the body that it’s time to wake up. Seeing this morning light allows melatonin (the ‘sleep hormone’) to filter out of the body, and essentially kick-starts digestion, brain power, and energy for the day. \r\n\r\nIf we miss out on this morning light, melatonin stays circulating around the body for longer, meaning we may feel groggy and tired, and digestion may be more sluggish.

Your body views them differently, and how you react to and work on addressing them is different too.\r\n\r\nBoth reactions to food ARE brought about by your body’s immune system. Your immune system’s job is to attack foreign invaders and eliminate them from your body to keep you healthy. And when your body attacks food proteins, it’s really just trying to do its job, it just gets a little confused.\r\n\r\nThe difference between a sensitivity and an allergy, though, stems from the type of antibody that gets released when your body senses a food it’s not too happy with.\r\n\r\nA food allergy calls IgE antibodies into action, while a food sensitivity will spark an attack by IgG or IgA antibodies.\r\n\r\nWhen these antibodies find the food they’re programmed to not agree with, they build up and attack it.
